Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed the article untitled _**"Global trade and bad governance, not poverty, are responsible for the unceasing deforestation in western Madagascar"**_ in which we analyzes further the deforestation process in western Madagascar.

#### Summary of the scientific results

In this article, using satellite image analysis, we first show that deforestation has dramatically and constantly increased on the period 1990-2014 in western Madagascar, demonstrating the unefficiency of past conservation strategies to curb deforestation in this area. Second, basing our analysis on household and stakeholder surveys, we show that subsistence agriculture for auto-consumption is not the main cause of deforestation in western Madagascar, contrary to what is commonly accepted. Instead, we identified slash-and-burn agriculture for the cultivation of cash crops (maize and peanut) and uncontrolled fires to open pastures as the two major causes of deforestation. Field surveys and review of reports on the maize and peanut sectors indicate that crop production is mainly exported outside Madagascar and that the money earned by farmers is invested into zebu herd acquisition. Export of agricultural commodities benefit to several intermediaries, some of who having political responsibilities. On the other hand, agents from institutions in charge of the management of the protected areas have no means to enforce law against deforestation. Third, we show that in the absence of any efficient strategy to curb deforestation in Madagascar, 50% of the forest would have disappeared in 2050 compared to 2010. Finally, we discuss the necessity of rethinking the environmental international aid in Madagascar. In order to stop deforestation, we argue that the aid should mainly be used at improving local governance to enforce the environmental law and that pressure should be put on international companies to buy certified agricultural commodities not derived from deforestation. 

#### Importance and originality of the research

Madagascar is recognized for both its unparalleled biodiversity, concentrated mainly in tropical forests, and its high level of threat which is associated in particular to deforestation [@Allnutt2008]. The disappearance of the tropical forest in Madagascar would be a terrible scenario for both local villagers in term of livelihoods [@Gardner2014] and at the global scale for biodiversity [@Goodman2005] and carbon emissions [@Vieilledent2016].

#### Impacts on conservation policy

Based on our study, we provide recommendations for conservation policy in Madagascar. We show that conservation and development programs implemented since the mid 1980s, focused on the extension of the protected area network and on agricultural development to increase productivity and reduce poverty, have failed at stopping deforestation and that we should rethink the international environmental aid [@Miller2013]. Actions should first aim at increasing governance in Madagascar to enforce the environmental law. Also, international community should put pressure on international companies to buy certified agricultural commodities not derived from deforestation.

#### Reproductibility and transparency of the research

All the data and codes used to generate the results of this study are made available publicly in a GitHub repository at the following web address: https://github.com/ghislainv/menabe.git. The results and the manuscript are fully reproducible running the R script `menabe.R` from the `menabe` git repository.

As a consequence, we think our study fits well into the scope of Conservation Letters which offers the publication of trandisciplinary studies 
producing recommendations for conservation policy. We hope you will find our study interesting and suitable for publication in your journal.
